# Alexandre Boving
I'm Alexandre from Italy, and I do Web development as well as design and implementations of Mobile Applications. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks such as React and React Native. Besides of those occupations, I'm really into AI technologies and some of my related repos are available. Eventually, I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux and design in general.
